## week 12 --- objects , class , method
___

### Class is a way to define an object to not repeat code
* To declare a class, you use the class keyword IE: class name{}
* the `extends` is used in class declarations to create a class as a child of another class and inherit its properties
* 'constructor()` is used to build a object inside the class 
* `super()` must be used inside a class with it inherit properties from another class
* `this` refers to the object

### method - methods are actions and functions that can be performed on objects.
* the correct way to call a method is `className.Methodname()`
* if you call a method without `()` ie : classname.methodname it will just return the definition of the method
