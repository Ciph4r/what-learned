  #### The front end of JS is where you assign what is shown on the console.log and what JS files to run on the terminal
  * `module.exports = '';` tells JS the name it given when being exported
  * `const calculate = require('')` what file is required to run this JS in node
  * `process.argv[]` tells node what order to assign the parameter inside the function. 0 will be the calling node and 1 is the console so it will always start at 2
